In 2003, CGIA used digital ortho photography from 1998 to verify the DWQ points for swine operations and to identify additional swine lagoons and barns visible in the photos. The intention is to display patterns of swine operations for planning and impact analysis without including attributes of the operations. Matching points to DWQ permits, for example, would take more research and processing.\n\nThese data were created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System &#40;GIS&#41;.",

The file identifies landfills in North Carolina from the LMOP Landfill Project, verfied using information provided by the Division of Waste Management, NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources. In addition, CGIA created 10-mile buffers around each landfill point and analyzed company locations within the buffers based on a dataset derived for the State Energy Office by the Appalachian Regional Development Institute at Appalachian State University from a Harris Company commercial database.\n\nThis data set was created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System &#40;GIS&#41;.",
